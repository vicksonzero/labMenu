## How to customize
1. edit `config.js` for folder names.  
    NOTE: I did not play with paths, so changing `config.js` may cause troubles such as deleting your whole folder
2. edit meta.json after first run to ignore certain folders
3. create a file called `labIgnore.txt` in certain folders to ignore them before first run
4. edit `folderName/.labEntry/project.json` to add descriptions and banners

## Disclaimer Again
This script plays with folder structures and may **DELETE** your folder structure and PROJECTS, or cause equivalent troubles.
